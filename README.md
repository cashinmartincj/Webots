# Webots
This is a webots project created from scratch, from designing the robot to integrating a controller.
The robot is programmed to move in certain shapes.
Different sensors like distance measuring sensors and compass sensors are used.
The ultimate challenge is to calibrate the camera and pick the right colour from the field- this includes setting the field lighting and altering the code on the controller side.
The camera calibration is explained in detail in the video file enclosed with this project.
You can also find the full working of the robot in the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dUTZ9fVpeik1Im60SYCkdXJx1E9iC9cJ/view?usp=sharing

You  at least have to know either one of the following programming languages {C, C++ or python}.
The attached controller file is programmed in C. So you will need a deep understanding of C programming to understand and alter the code.
